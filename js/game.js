  // velocity — which is the speed readout this game never had. At full impulse
  // the near stars draw as lines and you can feel the throttle without a gauge.
  //
  // There was a third: a planet in the middle distance, and a graticule of
  // range rings centred on the ship. Both are gone at James's request. They
  // were doing real work — depth, and a sense of distance — but the sector is
  // the backdrop to a fight, not the subject of one, and between them they
  // were the two biggest things on screen that the player never had to look at.
  //
  // TWO RULES GOVERN ALL OF IT, and between them they are worth more than the
  // entire rest of the frame. Both were learned the expensive way: the first
  // build of this layer ran the game at 29fps.
  //
  // 1 · A baked layer is baked at DEVICE resolution and blitted at exactly its
  //     own size, onto whole device pixels. A drawImage is a straight copy
  //     only under those conditions; miss any of them and it is resampled.
  //     Measured here, for the same five full-screen blits:
  //
  //         whole device pixels ................  3.2ms
  //         fractional destination ............. 26.2ms
  //         inside a 0.07-degree rotation ...... 33.7ms
  //
  //     The camera eases, so camY is fractional on nearly every frame and so
  //     is every parallax offset derived from it — hence snap() on every
  //     destination. The shake is snapped for the same reason and has no
  //     rotation at all.
  //
  // 2 · Count the full-screen blits, because a canvas that is not
  //     GPU-accelerated pays for every one of them in fill rate. This layer
  //     started as five — a nebula, two star layers of two tiles each — and it
  //     is now two, because the parallax that separated them was not buying
  //     anything: at a tenth of the scroll, across a nine-thousand-pixel page,
  //     the star layer travels about nine hundred pixels over an ENTIRE RUN.
  //     Nobody can perceive a parallax difference against a background that
  //     moves nine hundred pixels in ten minutes, so the cloud and the stars
  //     are baked into one tile and share one rate. What actually sells the
  //     depth is the near layer, which moves six times faster and is live.

  //
  //   scout   · Klingon Bird-of-Prey. Strafes past, takes pot shots. The
  //             baseline, and the thing every other hull is a departure from.
  //   raptor  · Klingon K'Tinga. Does not circle and does not track: it lines
  //             up, commits to a run straight THROUGH you at speed, shoots
  //             only while it is on that line, then coasts out and comes back.
  //             Briefly harmless, briefly lethal, on a rhythm you can learn.
  //   lancer  · Cardassian Galor. A slow platform that fires in fans. Answered
  //             by getting out of the cone rather than out of the way.
  //   stalker · Klingon Bird-of-Prey, heavy. Steers at you and leads its
  //             shots — the first hull that a straight line away does not beat.
  //   warbird · Romulan Warbird. Never closes: holds station at four hundred
  //             pixels and slides sideways to keep it, so flying away does
  //             nothing. Lobs one slow plasma torpedo that follows you — and
  //             that you can SHOOT DOWN, which is the only enemy ordnance in
  //             the game your guns can answer.
  //   drone   · Borg cube. Straight at you, slowly, for ever. Does not dodge,
  //             does not lead, does not break off, takes a great deal of
  //             killing — and ADAPTS, taking half damage once it has absorbed
  //             enough, so the answer is to kill it quickly or not at all.
  //             Cuts with a tracking beam rather than shooting.
  //   weaver  · Tholian web ship. Is not trying to hit you at all. It flies to
  //             a point, stops, spins a web, and leaves. The web is what hurts
  //             you, and the shape of the field has changed. Killing it before
  //             the web sets is the entire interaction.
  //
  // `cap` is how many of a kind may be on the field at once, and it is doing
  // real work: two Borg cubes is pressure, four is a wall, and one web is an
  // obstacle where three is a cage.

  // quickly the phasers cycle, and how many plates it carries. Before this
  // the three hulls flew identically and only the opening weapon differed,
  // which made the first panel of the run a weapon menu wearing three ship
  // names.
  //
  // `drag` is the one that is not obvious. It is the per-frame speed bleed,
  // so a HIGHER number is a ship that KEEPS its speed. Top speed works out at
  // thrust / (1 - drag), which means drag sets the ceiling and thrust sets how
  // long you take to reach it. The Sovereign is slow because it has both
  // against it; the Defiant is quick because it has both for it.
  //
  // Retuned Sep 2026 because all three were too fast and too slippery. The
  // old drags (0.979-0.9825) kept the ship coasting for most of a second
  // after you let go, and the Defiant topped out near 640px/s — past the
  // point where a player can steer through a field of rock. Drag now bleeds
  // speed roughly twice as fast, so the ship goes where it is pointed and
  // stops soon after you stop pushing, and every top speed came down:
  //
  // Pulled further apart later in Sep 2026, because the three still flew
  // within about fifteen percent of each other on every axis and the pick
  // read as one ship in three paint jobs. Each hull now owns one axis
  // outright and pays for it on another:
  //
  //             top speed   coast (1/e)   turn     phasers    hull
  //   Defiant    ~500px/s      0.5s       205°/s   x1.22      3    the fast one
  //   Nova       ~420px/s      0.43s      275°/s   x0.87      2    the nimble one
  //   Sovereign  ~315px/s      0.72s      155°/s   x1.00      4    the heavy one
  //
  // (The Sovereign's phaser figure looks ordinary, but it fires a three-beam
  // cone from the first second, which is two and a half times the beams of
  // either escort. On the pick card that is what the Phasers row counts.)
  //
  // Thrust is set from those figures, not the other way round: thrust =

  // ONE MEASURE, ONE AXIS. The obvious summary chart plots score, chain,
  // dilithium and overcharges on the same grid — and it cannot be read,
  // because a chain of 14 and a score of 4970 do not share a scale: the three
  // small series lie flat along the floor pretending to be zero, and the only
  // line anyone can actually see is score. So the chart plots SCORE over time
  // and nothing else, and the other three become tiles, which is the right
  // form for a single number anyway.
  //
  // The second line is the SAME measure at a different time — your best run —
  // so it is the same hue a step darker rather than a second category. It is
  // also dashed and labelled at its end, which means identity never rests on
  // colour alone. Checked with the palette validator: ΔE 26.9 deuteranopia,
  // 27.7 normal vision, both well clear. The bright step sits above the usual
  // lightness band on purpose — cyan is the player in this game, everywhere,
  // and the run you just flew is the player.

  // weapons, and which one you have decides how the first two minutes of a
  // run are actually flown. Drawing one of those three at refit 2 used to be
  // the single biggest thing that happened to a run, and it happened to you
  // rather than being chosen — so they are now the hull you pick before the
  // field spawns, and the run opens with the weapon already warm.
  //
  // The other two are not gone, they are held back. The first opens at refit
  // 3 and the second at refit 5, counted in cards actually taken rather than
  // in the XP level, so a run that took three salvage cards off capital ships
  // reaches them three cards sooner. That ordering is the whole design: the
  // first third of a run is one weapon and the build on top of it, the middle
  // is the second weapon arriving into a ship already shaped, and only a long
  // run ever flies all three. Once a card is open it behaves like every other
  // card in the deck — rolled at random, stacked to its own max, no special
  // case anywhere in choose().

  // ── the upgrade roster ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

  // descends through them in this order: the CATEGORY, so a draw can be sorted
  // at a glance; the NAME, which is the headline — it is what the card is
  // called and it is what you say to yourself when you pick it; then a plain
  // SENTENCE saying what it actually does in ordinary words; then the FIGURES.
  // The name tells you which shipboard system this is; the sentence tells you
  // what taking it does to you. Every tier is smaller and dimmer than the one
  // above it, so the card has a single obvious top.
  //
  // The figures are still computed from the live stat functions rather than
  // written out, so a card can never promise a value the ship does not get,
  // and they are quoted in units a player can feel: shots per second, targets
  // hit, seconds of cover. No pixel counts — nobody can see 165px.
  //
  // ── the four words the whole deck is written in ──────────────────────────
  // A player reading three cards in a frozen second cannot also be learning a
  // vocabulary, so every card uses the same four nouns for the same four
  // things and never a synonym:
  //
  //   shot    one pull of the trigger. Rate is quoted in shots/sec.
  //   beam    one phaser round in flight. Damage, speed, range and how many
  //           targets it passes through are all properties of a BEAM.
  //   torpedo the homing warhead. Never "missile", never "round".
  //   mine    the thing you leave behind you. It is laid, never fired.
  //   hull    the plates you lose on a hit. Never "life", never "health".
  //
  // That is why the Cone quotes "beams per shot" and the Array quotes
  // "shots/sec" — the two figures look alike and mean different things, and
  // the nouns are what tells them apart.
  //
  // Every `benefit` is one short sentence, in the second person, ending in a
  // full stop. It is the line the card is picked on, so it says what YOU get
  // rather than what the system is called.

  //   Klingon     · rings, aimed volleys, the ram · wing: pincer — three
  //                 Birds-of-Prey surround you, mark a point, and all dive
  //                 through it at once
  //   Cardassian  · rotating spiral barrages, sweeping fans · wing: wall —
  //                 three Galors line abreast and fire in one parallel volley
  //   Romulan     · cloaks (cannot be hit), reappears behind you, homing
  //                 plasma salvo · wing: flank — a cloaked pair that decloaks
  //                 on opposite sides for a crossfire. Never hails: ambushes.
  //   Borg        · tracking cutting beams, a TRACTOR BEAM that drags you in,
  //                 adapts at every quarter of hull · wing: box — four drones
  //                 in a rotating square wired together by cutting beams,
  //                 closing in. Cannot be outrun: the hail offers no escape.
  //   Tholian     · web cages spun around you, shards that split in flight ·
  //                 wing: strand — three weavers sweeping across the field
  //                 with a live strand between them
  //
  // And a capital-ship fight is now the only fight on the field: the ordinary

  // ── painted hulls ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Since Sep 2026 every ship is PAINTED, not outlined. The old hulls were a
  // neon stroke round a dark fill, and next to James's reference sheet —
  // weathered metal, plating, glass, lit windows, engine glow — they read as
  // badges. A canvas cannot afford that much work per ship per frame, so the
  // work is done once: each hull is painted at full detail into its own
  // offscreen canvas the first time it is needed, and every frame after that
  // is a single rotated drawImage. That is cheaper than the old outlines,
  // which paid for a shadowBlur on every stroke of every ship every frame.
  //
  // What stays live, because it moves: exhaust plumes, wingtip strobes, the
  // hit flash (a white copy of the silhouette, faded), cloaking (alpha),
  // shields, beams, webs, the reactor core that swells on a Klingon charge.
  //
  // The painting has one grammar for every faction: a soft shadow cast on the
  // field below, metal lit from above (the same side the rock facets are lit
  // from), plating in lighter and darker panels, the body's shadow where it
  // meets the wings, bevelled seams, glass and windows, glowing engines, and a
  // thin rim in the faction's colour so every hull still reads against space.
  // Only the materials change: Klingon rust-bronze, Cardassian ochre, Romulan
  // jade, Borg gunmetal with green circuitry, Tholian amber crystal, and the
  // player's Federation grey with a cyan rim — cyan is still the player.

  // nothing ever said what had just happened. A gauge labelled CORE filling by
  // five percent when you squeezed past a rock is not an explanation; it is a
  // number moving in the corner while your eyes are somewhere else.
  //
  // So the game says it, once, at the exact moment it first becomes true — and
  // then never again, because a tip that repeats is noise. The ready prompt is
  // the exception: it keeps appearing every time the core fills until the
  // player has actually vented once, on the grounds that a prompt you have
  // never acted on has not yet done its job.
