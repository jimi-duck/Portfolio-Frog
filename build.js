/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Stamp the shared chrome into every page.

   The nav, the site menu, the footer and the boilerplate at the top of <head>
   are the same on all eight pages. They used to be eight copies — about 41KB,
   a fifth of all the HTML on the site — and they had already drifted: the 404
   and the homepage wrote é and ↗ as literals, the other six wrote &eacute; and
   &#8599;, and nobody had noticed because nothing compares them.

   So the source of truth for those blocks is partials/, and this writes them
   into each page between a pair of marker comments:

       <!-- @nav -->  … everything here is generated …  <!-- /@nav -->

   What it does NOT do is turn the pages into templates. The committed .html
   files stay complete, readable, working HTML — you can open one in a browser
   from the filesystem, and GitHub Pages serves them as they are. This only
   rewrites the marked regions, which is why it is safe to run at any time and
   why running it twice changes nothing.

       node build.js          stamp the partials into every page
       node build.js --check  report any page that is out of date, and exit 1

   --check is the one to run before you commit, or in CI. It never writes.

   TO ADD A PAGE: add it to PAGES below, and put the four marker pairs in it.
   TO CHANGE THE NAV OR FOOTER: edit partials/, then run this.

          other page it is simply there. Keeping that per-page rather than
